<h1>Lab 9 – Iterators and generators</h1>

<ul>
    <li>A Customer has an id, a name, a city and set of bills, divided in two piles: the paid ones and the unpaid ones.</li>
    <li>When the customer gets a new bill, the bill goes to the unpaid pile.</li>
    <li>When the customer pays a bill, the bill gets transferred to the unpaid pile.</li>
    <li>Each bill has a unique identifier and an amount to be paid.</li>
</ul>

You have to be able to use your application like this:

<code>
let c1 = createCustomer(1,"Mario","Roma");
c1.bills.add({number: "ab123", amount : 123});
c1.bills.add({number: "cd456", amount : 456});
c1.bills.add({number: "ef789", amount : 789});
c1.bills.add({number: "gh012", amount : 128});
c1.bills.add({number: "ij386", amount : 946});

console.log("*********unpaid***********");
for(let b of c1.bills.unpaid()){
    console.log(b.number, b.amount);
}

c1.bills.pay("ef789");
c1.bills.pay("cd456");

console.log("*********unpaid***********");
for(let b of c1.bills.unpaid()){
    console.log(b.number, b.amount);
}

console.log("*********paid***********");
for(let b of c1.bills.paid()){
    console.log(b.number, b.amount);
}
</code>

NOTE:  You will need the polyfill.js file from a Babel polyfill installation. The easiest way to get this is to run npm install babel-polyfill (you already did this during lab1), then copy the polyfill.js file from the dist directory in the installed module.
Once you have polyfill.js, include it in your page via a script tag. In order for the polyfill to work, it must be included before any compiled ES2015 code from Babel.
